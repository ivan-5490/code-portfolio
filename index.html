      <h1>Ivan's <br> creative coding portfolio</h1>
      <h3>Ivan Aguilera is a student at the University of Illinois at Chicago in the class of 2024. Ivan enjoys making simplistic abstract art thatâ€™s made up of a bunch of random shapes that kinda look put together to be considered art. He believes that coding and art are interconnected and if done correctly can output very aesthetically pleasing images. His art are distinguishable from other's because they look like you can make them in microsoft paint. He also really likes skyline art.</h3>
